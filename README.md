# Project README.md

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to automate the process of logging into a website that implements Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using Python. The example uses Selenium WebDriver for web automation and Google's Gmail service for handling the 2FA OTPs.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system.
- Selenium WebDriver installed (`pip install selenium`).
- A valid Gmail account configured for 2FA.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Download and Extract Code

Download the provided code from the link below and extract its contents.

### Step 2: Study the Functionality

Thoroughly review the code to understand how it interacts with the target website and handles 2FA authentication.

### Step 3: Configure Your Details

Fill in the required details within the script:

- **Login URL**: The URL of the website you're trying to access.
- **Website Username**: Your username for the target website.
- **Website Password**: Your password for the target website.
- **Gmail Username**: Your Gmail address.
- **Gmail App Password**: An app-specific password generated from your Gmail account settings.

### Step 4: Update XPaths

Adjust the XPaths in the script to match the current structure of the target website's login form.

### Step 5: Run the Script

Execute the script in non-headless mode to observe the automation process. This will allow you to see the steps being performed live.
